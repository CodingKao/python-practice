# The time value of money is a financial concept that recognizes the idea that a sum of money has a different value today compared to its value in the future. The principle behind TVM is based on the fact that money can earn interest or have different purchasing power over time.

# The basic TVM formulas involve present value (PV), future value (FV), interest rate (r), and the number of periods (n):
# Present value = FV / (1 + r)^n
# Future value = PV * (1 + R)^n

# where"
# PV is the present value,
# FV is the future value,
# r is the interest rate per period,
# n is the number of periods
