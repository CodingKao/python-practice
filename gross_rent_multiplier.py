# The Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM) is a real estate metric used to evaluate the potential value of an investment property.

# The Gross Rent Multiplier is often used as a quick and rough measure to assess the relative value of different investment properties. A lower GRM generally suggests that the property may be a better value because it indicates a shorter time for the property to pay for itself based on the rental income.
